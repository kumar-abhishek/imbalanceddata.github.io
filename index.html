        <p>
          As machine learning practitioners, we often encounter imbalanced
          datasets in which one class has considerably fewer instances than the
          other. Many machine learning algorithms assume an equilibrium between
          majority and minority classes, leading to a suboptimal performance on
          imbalanced data. Addressing class imbalance is crucial for
          significantly improving model performance. Machine Learning for
          Imbalanced Data begins by introducing the challenges posed by
          imbalanced datasets and the importance of addressing these issues. It
          then guides you through techniques that enhance performance on
          imbalanced data when using classical machine learning models,
          including various sampling and cost-sensitive learning methods. As you
          progress, the book delves into similar and more advanced techniques
          for deep learning models, employing PyTorch as the primary framework.
          Throughout the book, hands-on examples provide working, reproducible
          code that demonstrates the practical implementation of each technique.
          By the end of this book, you will be adept at identifying and
          addressing class imbalances, and confidently applying various
          techniques including sampling, cost-sensitive techniques, and
          threshold adjustment when using traditional machine learning or deep
          learning models.
